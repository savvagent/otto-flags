//! The OAuth resource server: what stands between a bearer token and the flags.
//!
//! The authorization server is the otto platform; it mints tokens and this
//! service never sees how. This module is the *resource* server, and it has
//! exactly three jobs, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Refuse an unauthenticated request in a way that teaches the client how
//!    to authenticate.** A `401` carrying
//!    `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…"` (RFC 9728) is the entire
//!    onboarding story: the user pastes one MCP URL into their agent, the agent
//!    gets this header, follows it to the metadata document, finds the
//!    authorization server (the platform), registers itself, and opens a
//!    browser. Nothing else is configured anywhere. Get this header wrong and the
//!    product's premise — one URL, no install — stops working, in a way that
//!    looks to the user like "the server is broken".
//! 2. **Ask the platform whether the token is good for us** (RFC 7662
//!    introspection, `PlatformClient::introspect`). The platform enforces the
//!    audience: a token minted for any other resource comes back inactive. This
//!    is the confused-deputy defense and it is why this service's canonical URI
//!    is configuration rather than something derived from the request's `Host`
//!    header — a header an attacker controls is not a thing to compare an
//!    audience against.
//! 3. **Attach the principal to the request**, so handlers downstream have an
//!    org and a user without re-deciding authorization per tool.
//!
//! **A platform outage is a `503`, never a `401`.** `401` tells an agent its
//! token is dead and sends it to re-authenticate against the very platform that
//! is down; every connected agent would stampede it at the worst moment. Only
//! the platform *answering* "inactive" is a `401`.
//!
//! **The principal is per request, not per session.** An MCP session spans many
//! HTTP requests, and the token is introspected on every one. The client caches a
//! positive answer for 60 seconds, which is the whole revocation delay: a token
//! revoked, or a member removed, at the platform stops working here within that
//! window rather than whenever the MCP session happens to end.
