//! The flag-change stream, `GET /api/flags/stream` (`docs/SDK-DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md`, Real-time Updates),
//! which invalidates cached evaluations so a flag change, a kill switch above all, reaches the
//! client in about a round trip instead of after the cache TTL (#167).
//!
//! One background task per client family (every clone shares it) holds one long-lived
//! connection and ends when the last clone is dropped, as the telemetry flusher does. A
//! `flag.created`, `flag.updated` or `flag.deleted` event invalidates that flag through the
//! cache's generation counters, so an evaluation in flight when it arrived is not cached either
//! (#137). Each `connected` event (the server sends one on every connect) invalidates the whole
//! cache: events may have been missed while the stream was down, and the TTL bounds staleness in
//! the meantime. Lookups never wait on the stream: the task only writes to the cache.
//!
//! A dropped or refused stream is retried with exponential backoff and jitter; the attempt count
//! resets only after a connection stayed up [`STABLE_AFTER`], so a server that accepts and drops
//! at once is not retried at the base delay forever. Stream failures are logged and swallowed;
//! they never open the evaluate cooldown (`crate::backoff`), which is about lookups. The key is
//! sent only in the `Authorization` header and never logged.
